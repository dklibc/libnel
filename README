== libnel ==

Custom library for netlink iterface. Written on C.
Standard libnl, libnl-route, ... are big enough for
using on routers, so we've created a custom one.
Like libnl-tiny in OpenWrt. Now we think that more
useful would be to make API identical to libnl API,
but we didin't.

* libnel -- core helper library. Implements API to
netlink.

* libnel-route -- based on libnel. Implements API
for interfaces and ip management.

To debug define environment variable NLOG_DEBUG.

For testing libnel-route we've created a simple cmdline util 'ip':
Usage: ip [OPTIONS] OBJECT CMD [CMD_OPTIONS]\n"
Options: -d -- log level info, -d2 -- log level debug
  $ ip link [show [IFACE]]
  $ ip link set IFACE up|down
  $ ip addr [show [IFACE]]
  $ ip addr add|del IFACE ADDR/BITS
